        <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p class="second_paraghraph">I love reading. Whenever I read a book, it soothes me. I feel that reading has
            a healing affect on me.
            I am very inquisitive. I love learning. I love travel however, if I open a book and read about the
            history of the city that I am traveling, that doubles the joy of traveling experience. I love wine. I
            love reading about the history of the wine that I drink or geography of the wine, what kind of climate
            it comes from, and etc! I am also very into music. My favorite genre is Rock and I play guitar!
